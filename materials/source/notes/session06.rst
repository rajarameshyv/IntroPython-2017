Feedback
========

We got the results of the feedback survey last week.

We really do read the comments and try to improve the class as we go.

So Thanks!

And you'll get another chance at the end of class, which we also appreciate.


Issues that came up during the week.
====================================

Getting an arbitrary key from a dict
------------------------------------

See ``arbitrary_key.py`` in `solutions/session04`

dict as switch -- how do you leave the loop?
--------------------------------------------

Let's look at Eowyn's solution...


globals??
---------

a number of you have been putting code in the global (module) namespace:

.. code-block:: python

   the_dict = {}

   def fun():
       ...
       the_dict = something()

What's wrong with this?

More on keyword arguments:
