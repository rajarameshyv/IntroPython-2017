# Description: This script will accomplish the following goals:
# (1) It should have a data structure that holds a list of your donors and a history of the amounts they have donated.
# This structure should be populated at first with at least five donors, with between 1 and 3 donations each.
# You can store that data structure in the global namespace.
# (2) The script should prompt the user (you) to chooose from a menu of 3 actions:
# Send a Thank You", "Create a Report" or "Quit".
# Comments: Remember to use verbs for function names and nouns for variables.
# In addition, you can use a dictionary; however try to use list and tuples for this assignment
