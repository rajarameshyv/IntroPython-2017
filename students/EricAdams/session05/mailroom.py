"""
Used Chris's solution to session 3 version and added to it to create this,
(session 4) version

Mailroom Exercise -- as of Session 4--  dictionaries yes  Exceptions no

Note: this is not the most robust or flexible code -- but it does the
job with the simplest of Python data structures.

Adding dictionaries
Adding function send_thank_you_to_file.
Adding some exception and exception handling
Adding comprehensions
